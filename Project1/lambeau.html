        <h3>
          The above are Randall Cobb (On the left) and Davante Adams (On the
          right). These have been two of Rodgers closest friends for many years
          as they train, party, and basically live together during the football
          season. Choosing to play for another team would involve leaving all of
          these close friends he's made over the years.

        <h3>
          Packers fan base are known as the Cheeseheads and are some of the most
          die hard and kind fans in all of sports. They have all of their home
          games always sold out in freezing cold temperatures. We are also the
          only fanbase in the NFL to not have an owner but instead be owned by
          the community.

        /></a>

        <h3>
          No matter where Rodgers looks he will not find a better home with a
          better fanbase. It just makes sense for Rodgers to stay in Green Bay
          Wisconsin for the remainder of his career and make history with the
          people that mean the most to him.
