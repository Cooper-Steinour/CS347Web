          She is best known for her leading role as "Tris" Prior in the
          Divergent movie series based off the popular book. She was also the
          leading role in The Fault in our Stars which was a hit with the teen
          girl population.

        <h3>
          Rodgers and Shaliene Woodley started off their relationship hot and
          heavy over two and a half years ago. They have been engaged for the
          past two years. It is reported by the inner circle of Rodger's and
          Woodley's friends that they are not surprised about the breakup and
          they have been too busy focusing on their own careers over their
          romance. As of February of 2022 Rodgers is officially back on the
          market and any girl would be lucky to have this stud!
